# GitHub

We use GitHub for version control and collaboration. Currently, we have an
organization account, [uma-hive](https://github.com/uma-hive), and a personal
account, [umahive-personal](https://github.com/umahive-personal). The personal account is temporarily used for our
frontend project to bypass the limitations of Vercel's "Hobby" (free) plan for organizations. All other projects are
located in the organization repositories as per standard practice.
